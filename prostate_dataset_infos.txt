    Prostate Cancer Data


      Description

These data come from a study that examined the correlation between the
level of prostate specific antigen and a number of clinical measures in
men who were about to receive a radical prostatectomy. It is data frame
with 97 rows and 9 columns.


      Usage

data(Prostate)


      Format

The data frame has the following components:

|lcavol|
    log(cancer volume)
|lweight|
    log(prostate weight)
|age|
    age
|lbph|
    log(benign prostatic hyperplasia amount)
|svi|
    seminal vesicle invasion
|lcp|
    log(capsular penetration)
|gleason|
    Gleason score
|pgg45|
    percentage Gleason scores 4 or 5
|lpsa|
    log(prostate specific antigen)

      Examples

data(Prostate)
attach(Prostate)
pairs(Prostate, col = 1+svi, pch = gleason - 5,
      main = paste("Prostate data, n = ", nrow(Prostate)))
detach()

l1c.P <- l1ce(lcavol ~ ., data = Prostate)
coef(l1c.P)[coef(l1c.P) != 0] ## only age, lcp, lpsa (+ intercept)
summary(l1c.P)
